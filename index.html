<p>Once upon a time, there was a little girl who lived in a village near the forest.
      Whenever she went out, the little girl wore a red riding cloak, so everyone in the village called her
       Little Red Riding Hood.
    One morning, Little Red Riding Hood asked her mother if she could go to visit her grandmother as it 
    had been awhile since they'd seen each other.</p>
    <p>"That's a good idea," her mother said.  So they packed a nice basket for Little Red Rid
        ing Hood to take to her grandmother.

        When the basket was ready, the little girl put on her red cloak and kissed her moth
        er goodbye.
        "Remember, go straight to Grandma's house," her mother cautioned.  "Don't dawdle along the way and please don't talk to strangers!  The woods are dangerous."
        "Don't worry, mommy</p>
<p>Little Red Riding Hood was enjoying the warm summer day so much, that she didn't notice a dark shadow approaching out of the forest behind her...

    Suddenly, the wolf appeared beside her.
    
    "What are you doing out here, little girl?" the wolf asked in a voice as friendly as he could muster.
    
    "I'm on my way to see my Grandma who lives through the forest, near the brook,"  Little Red Riding Hood replied.
    
    Then she realized how late she was and quickly excused herself, rushing down the path to her Grandma's house.</p>
<p>The wolf, in the meantime, took a shortcut...

    The wolf, a little out of breath from running, arrived at Grandma's and knocked lightly at the door.
    
    "Oh thank goodness dear!  Come in, come in!  I was worried sick that something had happened to you in the forest," said Grandma thinking that the knock was her granddaughter.
    
    The wolf let himself in.  Poor Granny did not have time to say another word, before the wolf gobbled her up!
    
    The wolf let out a satisfied burp, and then poked through Granny's wardrobe to find a nightgown that he liked.  He added a frilly sleeping cap, and for good measure, dabbed some of Granny's perfume behind his pointy ears.
    
    A few minutes later, Red Riding Hood knocked on the door.  The wolf jumped into bed and pulled the covers over his nose.  "Who is it?" he called in a cackly voice.
    
    "It's me, Little Red Riding Hood."
    
    "Oh how lovely!  Do come in, my dear," croaked the wolf.</p>
